Automation Scripts Repository

Welcome to the Automation Scripts repository! This collection of scripts was developed and is maintained by me, with the goal of automating various tasks that I regularly perform in my day-to-day work or personal projects. By automating these tasks, I aim to increase efficiency and save time while ensuring that repetitive processes are handled seamlessly.
Purpose

This repository primarily serves as a personal archive of the scripts I use for automating various tasks. These include, but are not limited to:

    File management
    System maintenance
    Data scraping and processing
    Task scheduling and management
    Ethical penetration testing (where applicable)

These scripts were created to help me streamline processes, improve productivity, and handle tasks more effectively. While I am sharing them publicly to demonstrate automation techniques, these scripts are intended for educational purposes only. They should be used responsibly and ethically. I encourage users to modify the scripts to suit their own needs, but not for malicious or unauthorized activities.
