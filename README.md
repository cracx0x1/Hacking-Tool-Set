# Hacking-Tool-Set
Overview

The Hacking Tool Set repository contains a collection of tools designed for penetration testers and cybersecurity enthusiasts. This includes an advanced SSH brute-forcing script built using Python and pwntools.

The script demonstrates how to automate attempts to identify valid credentials on an SSH server using a password list, with robust error handling and user-friendly feedback.
Features

    Automates SSH brute-force attacks with real-time progress tracking.
    Handles common SSH exceptions gracefully.
    Easily customizable for different targets and configurations.
    Built with pwntools and paramiko for simplicity and reliability.
    Provides detailed logs for each password attempt.

How to Use
Prerequisites

    Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
    Install the required dependencies:

    pip3 install paramiko pwntools

Usage

    Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/carcx0x1/hacking-tool-set.git
cd hacking-tool-set

Configure the script:

    Edit the host, username, and password_file variables in the script:

    host = "TARGET_IP_OR_HOSTNAME"  # Replace with the target IP/hostname
    username = "USERNAME"  # Replace with the target username
    password_file = "ssh-common-passwords.txt"  # Path to your password list

Run the script:

    python3 script_name.py

    The script will iterate through the passwords in the file and attempt to authenticate.
